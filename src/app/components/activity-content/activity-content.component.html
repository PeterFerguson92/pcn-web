          Our <strong>Morning Devotion</strong> is a daily time of worship,
          scripture reading, and reflection designed to help you center your
          heart on God before the busyness of the day begins.

        <p>Each session includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A short worship song or hymn</li>
          <li>A scripture reading with practical insights</li>
          <li>Guided prayer and time for personal reflection</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Whether you're joining us at the church or tuning in from home, this
          sacred morning rhythm offers spiritual renewal and a gentle reminder
          of God's presence throughout your day.
