            Online Gatekeepers – Prayer Intercession Group
          </h4>
          <p>
            Prayer Intercession is the act of standing in the gap
            through prayer—lifting up the needs of others, the church,
            and the world before God. It is a powerful ministry of love,
            faith, and spiritual warfare that invites heaven’s will to
            be done on earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Online Gatekeepers is a dedicated team of believers who meet
            virtually to stand in prayer over the church, community, and global
            issues. As spiritual watchmen, we are committed to guarding the
            gates through consistent intercession, prophetic insight, and
            Spirit-led prayer.
